# Redux Toolkit Learning Project

This project is aimed at research and self-learning of Redux Toolkit, a powerful library for managing state in React applications. The goal is to gain hands-on experience and practice with Redux Toolkit by building a simple application.

## Description

As a part of my learning journey, I've created this project to deepen my understanding of Redux Toolkit. Through this project, I aim to explore various features and best practices offered by Redux Toolkit for state management in React applications. By building a small-scale application, I intend to apply the concepts learned and experiment with different scenarios to solidify my knowledge.
